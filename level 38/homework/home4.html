I would not go to England just to prove that I can play there. I do not have to go to England... If I go there it's because for me and for my family it is a good choice. That's the key for me."[44]
            
            On 10 August, it was reported that Manchester City had made a second bid for De Bruyne worth £47 million.

Klaus Allofs said that City had made an "astonishing" wage offer to De Bruyne.[46]</i></p>

                    <p><i><u><b>De Bruyne</b></u> was capped by Belgium at under-18, under-19, and under-21 level.

                            <p><i>A versatile and highly talented player in the media, he plays mainly as a attacking or an central midfielder but can also operate in several other positions and has been used as a winger or second striker. He has even been deployed in a deeper creative midfield position and on occasion, a box-to-box role or as a false 9. He is often described by pundits as one of the best and most complete modern day advanced playmakers due to his technique, skill, athleticism, work-rate off the ball, vision, crossing accuracy, wide range of passing, and powerful long-range shooting ability with either foot.[185][186][187][188][189][190][191][192]

                                Although he is not blessed with significant physical strength, pace, or ability in the air,[193] he is a quick and elegant player on the ball with good dribbling skills, while his positional sense, tactical intelligence, movement, direct style of play and ability to run at defences when in possession also enable him to take advantage of spaces in the opposition's defence and subsequently create chances and goalscoring opportunities for himself or his teammates, making him a dangerous offensive threat on counter-attacks.[193][194][195][196] In addition to his creative abilities,[193] he is also capable of scoring goals by making late runs off the ball from behind into the penalty area[197] and is an accurate set-piece taker.[193][198]</i></p>

    <p><i><b><u>De Bruyne's</u></b> mother is Belgian.[211] She was born in Burundi and has also lived in the Ivory Coast.[212] She grew up in London, after her Flemish parents moved to England for work reasons. Only when she met Kevin's father, Herwig, did she return to Belgium.[213]

        De Bruyne's parents settled in Drongen, a sub-municipality of the city of Ghent, in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium.[214][215] Aside from Dutch, his mother tongue, De Bruyne also speaks English, French and German.[216][217]
        
        As a child, De Bruyne and his parents regularly visited his grandparents in London. At the time of his move to Chelsea in 2012, De Bruyne stated: "We used to go every year at Christmas and during school holidays. It's my second home."[218]
        
        De Bruyne has been in a relationship with Michèle Lacroix since 2014.[219] The couple married in June 2017[220] and have three children together.[221]
        
        De Bruyne's autobiography, titled Keep It Simple, was published by Borgerhoff & Lamberigts in October 2014,[222] following an incident between De Bruyne and his compatriot, footballer Thibaut Courtois, in which De Bruyne's then-girlfriend left him for Courtois. De Bruyne wrote in his autobiography, "Although I still cannot believe what Courtois has done, we continue to work together professionally."[223]
        
        De Bruyne was an ambassador for the 2014 Special Olympics, which took place in Antwerp, and was involved in a controversial advertisement campaign via his personal Instagram account. Employing the slogan (in Dutch): "Would you still be my fan if I looked like this?", De Bruyne was depicted resembling a person with Down's syndrome.[224]</i></p>
